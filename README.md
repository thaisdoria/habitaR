# habitaR
An R package to create, manage and validate species' distribution maps. It is mainly based on the approach of species' Area of Habitat (AOH) as described in Rondinini et al. (2011) and Brooks et al. (2019). It is also useful to perform the over-predicting correction of Species Distribution Models (SDMs) proposed by Kremen et al. (2008) and to develop SDMs-derived distribution maps following Syfert et al. (2014).
